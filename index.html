         <h1 class="settingStoryTitleTest">Are you Jocelyn?</h1>
         <p class="indent">He walked through the hallways of Springside Chestnut Hill Academy with a certain ease - not necessarily of disregard for his surroundings and whereabouts, but the ease of someone careless; he seemed it from his strut, gradually swaying as he walked, his feet outstretched only slightly but enough to be a noticeable feature of his stride. His back was hunched despite there being no weight atop it: he carried a jet black suitcase and no bags. His sleeves were rolled to his knuckles, and eyes stoic and downward facing  - distant but not disdainful.  Around his neck, concealed by his top, he had a silver locket containing a note. “You’ve got a daughter, Roy. Jocelyn. She’s got the most beautiful green eyes you’ll ever see. I’ll see you in 19 days,” it read. The only flashy attribute of his presentation was a watch he wore backwards but made special attention to conceal: it was a deep gold, like the walls of Versailles, a tone his taste would usually deem tacky. Regardless, he wore it. It was once his father’s and his father’s before him. His odd walk, though, rarely attracted any attention; others of the school were far too preoccupied in their business to notice it. He was discrete as he passed them, noticing their conversations morph. As they went past, their once-distinct words gradually melted together, moulding into an indiscernible mesh of nonsensical chatter. He observed this but thought nothing of it. It simply was how things are meant to be.
         </p>
         <p class="indent">He found solace in nature but had little opportunity to indulge himself in its many awe-inspiring facets. Occasionally, when time permitted, he would immerse himself in the sliver of the outdoors he could reach with two odd strides. He sat at a bench that over the years he had become intimately familiar with. An ovular groove in the metal plaque embedded into its back was a permanent reminder of that intimacy. The bench lay overlooking the boundary of the school, the blissful rolling hills of a golf course occupying the majority of his view.
         </p>
         <p class="indent">Sitting there one evening, he recalled a time his father brought him to a great starlit mound behind his house. He recalled its snow-covered figure completely uninterrupted, so smooth it almost seemed to reflect the moon’s shimmering gaze. In a blood red wheelbarrow that appeared a nightly black under the spill of darkness he sat, being dragged along by his father who trenched through the snow with the wheelbarrow behind. The dreamy whiteness of the world became gashed in their tracks; the tires of the wheelbarrow distorted the purity of the mound, revealing dirt. He remembered reaching its top and looking over to his house. It seemed distant yet indescribably familiar. His father pushed him and the wheelbarrow down the mound, its perfect white smoothness corrupting in their destructive, blissful wake.

            <span class="caption">Snow Upon a Green Mound.</span><span class="smallCaption"> Photo by Aidan Villasis</span>
         </div>
         <p class="indent">The snow-covered mound of his memory then rapidly vanished, disrupted by the presence of a young girl crunching leaves which littered the unkempt sidewalk as she made her way around the bench. Walking past, she noticed the man’s stoic gaze but did not regard it. She was clearly distraught; the man could tell from the faux confidence in her stride and the hollowness of her emerald green eyes. He looked up as she passed, following her jittery figure with curiosity. She was dressed entirely in black and looked downward as he did in the school halls though lacking his ease. As she walked onward, the sound of her footsteps, of crunching and cackling autumn leaves, gradually dissipated, becoming faint and then indistinguishable from the distant hum of the nightly breeze. As quickly as she had appeared, she had vanished.
         </p>
         <p class="indent">The girl continued her evening walks around that golf course for some months, seeing the man sat at his bench but never greeting him. She did however notice the many facets of his character. She saw his suitcase, his watch, the ID card buttoned to his shirt, the loosened tie around his neck, and his locket. He seemed to always grasp his locket tightly whenever she passed. Her mother used to carry a locket as well. In that way, the man seemed familiar, and it was familiarity that the girl sought at that golf course. Her mother too used to walk the brick pathway surrounding those lush green hills, though when they did so together, the silence between them was chilling.
         </p>
         <p class="indent indentFinal">One particularly somber night, lantern lights spilled glittering luminescences upon the bench where the man sat, transforming the pure whiteness of the snow atop his eyelids into shimmering gold fragments like broken glass. That night, the man’s ease was gone. He waited under a golden coat of fluttering snow for that burdened girl to walk by, for the sound of her black crunching boots to echo throughout the hollow and empty nighttime air, announcing the presence of his daughter. He clenched the cold locket around his neck, imagining her sterile green eyes; he saw in those eyes familiarity, which he — like her — ultimately sought, sitting on that bench just over the golf course, its green hills now engulfed by a white blanket of undisturbed purity. The man held the locket until the warmth of his hands gave it new life, until it too shimmered gold under the lantern light. He sat, shivering and imagining, until the girl emerged with craters of disturbed snow behind her, revealing dirt and marking her path - isolating her. She was dressed in midnight black as she walked through the cold whiteness of winter. As the man lifted his head towards the girl, golden snow gracefully struck the ground, creating tiny mounds atop his boots. She pretended not to notice him. The girl continued to walk; in her wake, sole-shaped splotches of darkness interrupted the smooth illuminating surface of the hill. The man could now see the green of her eyes: amongst the whiteness of the world, they almost seemed to glow. He stood up, the snow upon his shoulders and legs tumbled downward, and met her gaze. She stopped and looked away quickly so as to seem confused, but it was only an act. She knew exactly why he stood, exactly why he sat at that bench. The girl then turned her head upward, the lantern light obfuscating her vision as she squinted back into the old man’s golden eyes. Squeezing the locket in his coat pocket as he trembled before the girl, he asked, “Jocelyn. Are you Jocelyn? Is that your name?” The girl hesitated, her pale face no longer hid any faux confidence. “No,” she replied, “I’m sorry. That’s not me.”

         <h1 class="narrativeNonfictionTitleTest storyTwo">Gallo Del Cielo</h1>
         <div class="gradientGalloDelCielo">
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As a youth, Carlos Zaragoza had never seen his father’s face. His mother, the only person for whom he had ever cared, lay still atop a makeshift bed built from wooden planks and hay. Her pale skin was cold to the touch and her breath was faint. Soon, he thought, he would be alone. The boy wanted to buy back the land stolen from his family long before. He wanted his mother to once again see the sun rise over Puerto Princesa, to assure that she would not die with the tingle of dried grass hidden behind her back. He wanted her to die in her own home.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp On a clear night, Zaragoza walked through the glowing city of Makati. Its great towers pierced the heavens and sprinkled glistening colors through the sky. In one pocket of his cargo shorts, he had his mother’s faded leather wallet, 50,000 pesos inside, and a small sheet of paper with directions leading to a fighting pit shakily drawn. There, he thought, 50,000 pesos would ride upon the fate of those sparring roosters until they turned to 1,000,000. In his other pocket, he had an unlocked balisong which rattled with each step. He jingled as he made his way down the streets. The distant-then-close whirring of cars brought him close to the edge of the sidewalk; he was curious to hear their sounds and see the people within them. He continued and the once-shimmering lights became sterile and casted blotches of yellow upon the unkempt pavement. Under this yellow haze, as if it had emerged from the night itself, a charcoal rooster appeared in front of the young Zaragoza and the jingling of his balisong ceased abruptly. The rooster stood confidently, its midnight coat reflected no yellow, manifesting only the darkness of night, a darkness he had become intimately familiar with. He bent down, squatting, and saw the whites of his eyes assimilate within the void of the rooster’s, its black pupils indistinct from the shadow casted by its proud crescent feathers. It remained still as Zaragoza shifted forward, only tilting its head as if to greet him. He cautiously extended both arms toward the bird until he could feel the stiffness of its feathers against his palm. He said to the rooster, “Gallo Del Cielo. That is your name” and lifted it above the ground. Del Cielo flapped his wings for but a second and was then again still in Zaragoza’s hands. “You will get my mother her land.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Zaragoza followed the dimming yellow lights, now dull and mucky, taking Del Cielo across the city to a fighting pit. The shrill scream of roosters drowned the chatter of men in the stands. Overhead lights flooded the fighting sand with bright colorless fluorescence. No more did glistening colors illuminate the night sky. No more did the sound of cars echo throughout the heavy city air. The night was now black and only the blindingly lit sand was distinct against the misty tropical haze. Zaragoza placed Del Cielo down onto the sand outside of the arena. He reached into his pocket, feeling the bite of his blade graze his finger as he drew the knife in his right hand. A drop of red fell upon Del Cielo’s black coat as his hand left his pocket. Zaragoza yanked the drawstring of his shorts and cut the base using the knife. He then lifted Del Cielo to the sky, his nightly wings spread over Zaragoza's outstretched skyward facing arm, and wrapped the bloody drawstring around the balisong and Del Cielo’s pale leg, attaching it to his right spur.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Zaragoza brought Del Cielo to the arena’s border. He did not speak as he handed his 50,000 pesos away, only looking into the lonely eyes of the man who many called “the bank.” He felt a ghastly sickness come about him as he entered the arena with the calm Del Cielo nestled under his arm. The grey rooster directly adjacent Del Cielo squirmed in Zaragoza’s opponents’ hands, screeching. His opponent had a certain easiness in his eyes, the confidence of a man familiar with this sport. Zaragoza looked down toward Del Cielo who seemed unburdened, peacefully and silently taunting his opponent. His mother’s land now silently sat atop the bite of Del Cielo’s spur. He imagined running home and not stopping; not stopping for the city lights or the sounds of the cars or fighting pits, without his knife and without burden, to present to his mother the bloody Del Cielo in his arms, the savior Gallo Del Cielo, who had brought back her land. A man shuffled quickly to the center of the pit and looked at both roosters, grinning at Del Cielo’s crude silver spur minted with the blood of Zaragoza. He stepped back and without delay, raised his arm outward. The faint and sudden cry of his whistle quickly dissolved amidst the yelling of men.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Zaragoza released Del Cielo and he fluttered to the ground, the balisong flapping and jingling as he descended. His skyward-bound opponent cast a moving shadow over the cowering figure of Del Cielo as he drove a steel-mounted blade across his breast. Black feathers tinted red flew across the sand. Del Cielo, with a maroon-stained gash through his front, flapped his dark wings -- sand circling beneath him, distorting the white pit’s strange uniformity -- and met the grey rooster far above his fallen feathers. The overhead fluorescence glistened against the silver of Del Cielo’s blade as it sunk into his opponent's chest, glowing specks of red masked the greyness of his breast as they descended to the ground. Del Cielo struck the ground and would not rise again. Zaragoza’s dream which lay upon his reddened spur was dragged through the sand as Del CIelo hollered a piercing scream. The signal man ran to separate the sparring roosters, shaking them both before raising the grey one by his barely-feathered neck to the sky.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Zaragoza, with stillness in his eyes, walked into the pit towards the trembling Del Cielo, who could see but not move to acknowledge him. He crouched over Del Cielo, covering the rooster’s enfeebled body under the nightly coat of his own shadow, and stared into his once bold eyes. He could not run home to his mother now, he could not bring her anything but the blood of the lost Del Cielo. He could not free her nor could he free himself. His pocket was now empty and his mother’s land lost; she would die atop her bed of wood and hay. Zaragoza reached out towards and clutched the neck of the frail bird with two smothering palms, shaking his bobbing head savagely. Del Cielo then, as if by the will of God, extended his blood painted wings to reveal an untouched charcoal underside. He fluttered, kicking grains into Zaragoza’s still eyes and, in a single swiping motion, sunk the red mounted balisong deep into the boy’s chest. He collapsed to the ground, unable to cry and with Del Cielo’s black choking head in his hand.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Frogs were humming and crickets were chirping on a humid summer night on the outskirts of the city of Makati. Carlos Zaragoza sat atop two stacked palm tree stumps, his back straight against an upright tire, and looked through a hole in the rusted tin walls of his home. The moonlight outlined the elegant figure of a jet black rooster, its head proudly pointed towards the heavens and its shadowy feathers untouched by even the sand upon the ground. Zaragoza, under the moon’s dim blanket of light, looked down towards his chest and into the remnants of a deep cavernous scar which covered it. The maroon gash ran deep through his muddy skin and had hardened into a bone-like ridge atop his chest. With every breath he took, Zaragoza felt silver spurs pierce his skin and grapple bone. He looked up again into the darkness but the rooster had vanished into the thick brush of night. His brown eyes narrowed and a wildness took his face. He slowly rose from his makeshift chair of stumps and tires with his back slouched and his neck bent forward. Zaragoza yelled into the night, the gash swelling and pulsating as he coughed out a bloody curse to Gallo Del Cielo. He collapsed, falling to the ground as his frail hands plunged into the sand, kicking grains into his squinting eyes. Then he was still, his face firmly planted in the sand floor of his home. He lay there, the first time he had felt matter upon his face in many years, and once again imagined the blade mounted to Cielo’s spurs piercing his chest as he tried to slow his breathing, to escape the slow pecking beak of misfortune.

         <div class="gradientNature">
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ​​The cold breath of morning tinted clear plastic windows grey with foggy residue. I could feel the rusted keel of that New York City water taxi rumbling as it spit chilled Hudson water from behind. Its warm interior and vibrating frame sent a deep and continuous resonance up the backs of the cold metal seats which lined the rocking deck. The sensation was strangely calming; it reminded me of August nights I’d spent stacking tiny sticks atop the flame of a barely-cackling fire, wiping black embers from my eyes.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Mere inches beyond that grey tinted shield, the bitter bite of winter whimpered against the scratched plastic. It seemed to grab me by a numb reddened ear, pulling me towards the glistening lights of the early morning skyline. Each building painted the lazy waves of the Hudson varying hues of yellow and white. Every photon emitted from a single fixture in a single room within a single building projected a dot upon the river's rolling surface. Individually, they were nothing more than specks. Together, though, those specks culminated in a great system of vibrant luminescence - visible even from space.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The city itself is a great organism. It breathes, it consumes, it produces, and it lives. Its blood flows underground, in the air, and on the streets, pumping resources through its yellow-lit veins. The city changes over time; it evolves and advances - it becomes better. The city is utterly relentless in its pursuit of perfection. As the rumbling water taxi treaded onwards towards that pulsating beacon of life, I could see through the morning fog the city’s unacknowledging gaze, lit by thousands of narrow and unwavering eyes.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Perhaps the only thing that I'll miss about the 'new normal' is the digitisation of everything. Throughout my time in lower and middle school, and freshman and sophomore years of high school, I have never found myself able to maintain a proper organization system. I would start the year strong with dedicated binders to house all of my papers neatly coupled with notebooks for every class. However, not very far into the year I would find old chemistry quizzes filling my math folder and quadratic functions littering English.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Last year, because of being virtual and as a result of  an administrative effort to reduce the amount of paper used in school, I finally -- even if not necessarily voluntarily -- took the plunge into digital note taking, and straight to the deep end I went. As an already digitally-oriented person, I had a Microsoft 365 subscription and access to all the tools I could ever need before I even entered high school. I stored personal files on OneDrive, occasionally used Word to write documents and used Powerpoint to create presentations. I had also bought an iPad (which I used to type this journal entry and possibly the best investment I’ve made as a student) not long before. Suffice it to say, I was well prepared for digital learning.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Like in years prior, I came into school (or logged in) with my red English folder, black math folder, purple Spanish folder, blue history folder, green science folder, and white miscellaneous folder empty and hungry for material. But no longer would they be shoved carelessly into my backpack with loose papers crumpled and tossed about. Rather, they were stored in some Microsoft server in another state (understandably, Microsoft does not disclose the exact location of their data centers) or in the magical Apple Cloud. Perhaps for the first time in my career as a student, there were no equations in my English notebook, no Spanish vocab in my science folder, and my notes weren’t crudely condensed into a pancake of knowledge at the bottom of my backpack. I developed a simple and intuitive organization and notetaking system that genuinely worked for me and, as strange as it feels to say it, I have the “new normal” to thank for that.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Innovation: a principle driving force of humanity, the difference between us and our animal relatives, a facet of our intelligence. We are driven by our innate desire to innovate in much the same way the robin is driven by innate desire to build a nest: it is instinctual. The difference between us and the robin, however, is that we do not settle; we are not satisfied living in a house of sticks. We are a dissatisfied species and in that dissatisfaction we seek only to improve, inching progressively closer to whatever perfection is. Our technology is the pinnacle of this desire and something that I find to be truly awe-inspiring - not just in what we’ve done, but an awe for what the future holds.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Not even 100 years ago, everyday components of our lives would have been inconceivable; our devices would appear to work by magic. We have literally moulded the natural elements of our world and created something new, something almost indescribably incredible. In the same way that termites build their mounds using dirt and robins build their nests using twigs, we manipulate our natural environment to construct cities and computers. A CPU is literally a chunk of metal that we taught to think! And that metal, over not a very long period of time, became smaller and smaller, and housed more and more transistors and cores until we reached the absolute limit of how small it could get and how much it could hold. So What do we do? We enter the quantum realm. Innovation does not stop. The next generation will continue to improve upon the collective discoveries of all prior generations. It is an innate desire to continually progress towards betterment that I think is applicable to every person. I’ve grown to love watching innovation occur in front of my very eyes and can say that it is definitely one of my favourite things.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Naval architecture has long been a niche interest of mine. Since kindergarten, I’ve marveled at the awe-inducing qualities of well designed and some not so well designed seafaring vessels (my then-favorite ship was the Titanic). This past summer, to celebrate my mother’s 50th birthday, my family went on a short 3 night Caribbean cruise. We were onboard the Freedom of the Seas, which was one of the first ships to leave port since COVID and thus had a severely reduced guest capacity. In actuality, the ship was practically vacant. The crew seemed to outnumber the guests by a ratio of at least 10:1. Our stateroom was the only one occupied in the entire section of our deck. Simply walking through the halls, the bulkheads seemed to span 10 meters wider than they actually were. The entire ship was devoid of people, was devoid of activity, but in that inactivity and apparent lifelessness, the true vastness of the vessel was apparent.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I recall walking across the promenade and forgetting I was even aboard a ship. The colorful lighting fixture sent dancing beams around the empty hall and across a little glass bridge which spanned over the lower levels. The background music almost seemed blaring over the quietness of everything else. Looking up towards the windows of the interior-oriented staterooms, it was like being surrounded by towering apartments, most of which had closed and untouched curtains.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I also remember leaving the ship and staring upwards with an ache in my neck towards it’s immense baby blue hull. I noticed two crew members peeking out from an opening and painting that blue hull with the largest paint roller I’d ever seen. I thought the situation was curious and decided to photograph it. In that photo, the immensity and vastness of the ship is truly visible. The overpowering blueness of the massive vessel encompases the entire frame with the only non-blue elements being the two comparatively tiny people and their bright yellow paint roller. They paint what is already intensely blue in yet another coat of blue.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Through symbolism, Tim O’Brien characterizes Jimmy Cross as a deeply burdened soldier, desperately seeking an escape from war through an obsessive fantasy of faux love. Cross’s love for Martha is a deeply embedded facet of his character and O’Brien uses it to display his yearning for home and familiarity. Martha sent letters and other items from America to Cross, which he uses to immerse himself in an adolescent love fantasy and temporarily return to his hometown. In one instance, Martha sent over a pebble which Cross carried in his mouth, physically immersing himself in Martha’s presence and the presence of home. O’Brien uses this image to highlight the disturbingly sexual nature of Cross’s overt obsession for Martha. While carrying the pebble in his mouth, Cross “would slip away into daydreams, just pretending, walking barefoot along the Jersey shore, with Martha…” (4) showcasing his incredible urge to return to the familiarity of home and his becoming aloof in imagining it. The burden Cross experiences as a result of this fantasy is shown when he becomes fixated to the point of neglecting his duties as a lieutenant, eventually resulting in the death of Ted Lavender. Now “this was something he could have to carry like a stone in his stomach for the rest of the war.” (8) O’Brien again characterizes Jimmy Cross using stones to highlight his mental burdens: like the stone in Cross’s mouth representing his obsessive love from Martha and desire to escape, the burden of Lavender's death -- the ultimate result of that desire -- would be a stone embedded in his stomach and would remain a permanent embedment deep within him.

         <h1 class="analyticaltitleText gradientTextOne">Awe<span class="subText"> Cheryl Strayed and Ta-Nehisi Coates</span></h1>
         <div class="gradientTextOne">
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Both Cheryl Strayed and Ta-Nehisi Coates used imagery to elicit a sense of vastness and create awe, an incredibly powerful sense of wonder, in their respective works. In an excerpt of Between the World and Me (pages 39-43), Coates wrote of the wonders of the campus of Howard University. It was a source of awe, being called “Mecca,” in reference to the city where every Muslim takes a pilgrimate to. The campus is, similar to Mecca, a conglomeration of people of vastly different cultures coming together from regions separated by vast distance. Coates writes that  “the vastness of black people across space-time could be experienced in a twenty-minute walk across campus,” (41) describing the cultural vastness encompassing the campus of Howard University. Space-time is perhaps the most vast thing one can imagine, spanning literally everything physically and temporally, and Coates attributes this same vastness to the campus and the individuals who occupy the campus. Coates describes the campus as inducing--through its Mecca-like cultural diversity--the same awe that arises from stargazing and seeing the vastness of space. In a similar manner, Strayed elicits a sense of vastness when describing the natural environment that surrounds her to create awe in Wild. However, this vastness arose from the physical characteristics of the land rather than those who encompassed it, as Coates’ description of the Howard campus did. Strayed used a variety of sensory images to write of the awe-inducing qualities of the forest. Strayed “gazed across the great green expanse,” filling the reader’s imagination with lush foliage spanning miles, and “went days without seeing another person,” further eliciting a sense of isolation and physical vastness. This vastness, just like the expanse of space, creates a sense of wonder and awe in the reader.
